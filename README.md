Project completed 09/01/24.

### Project Overview
This project uses python aswell as the pandas and numpy libraries, to perform analysis on bikeshare data across three cities - New York, Chicago and Washington.

### Description
The program takes user input for which city to view data, the month to view (includes option for 'all' months), and the day of the week (includes an option for 'all' days).

Upon receiving user input, the user is asked whether they would like to view 5 rows of raw data, with the option after to show another 5 or end the program.

After the user input for this prompt is received, the program will display the following:

* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Type of users by number

* Most common birth year amongst users (where applicable)

This is followed by a prompt giving the choice to restart the program.
